## What it does

mailtrim gives you two ways to manage your inbox:

**CLI** — run anywhere, no browser needed:
```bash
mailtrim stats     # rank senders by storage impact
mailtrim purge     # bulk-delete by sender — goes to Trash, undo anytime
mailtrim triage    # AI classifies every unread: priority, action, why
```

**Web UI** — full interface at `localhost:8484`:
```bash
pip install "mailtrim[web]"
mailtrim serve
```

Both run entirely on your machine. No subscription. No telemetry. AI is off by default.

---

## Safety guarantees

| Guarantee | How it works |
|---|---|
| Trash first | Every delete moves mail to Trash — never permanent |
| Full undo | `mailtrim undo` reverses any operation within 30 days |
| No cloud required | `stats`, `purge`, `undo`, `setup` are 100% local |
| AI is opt-in | AI is `off` by default — enable explicitly |
| Sensitive senders protected | Banks, healthcare, legal senders are flagged and never auto-suggested |

---

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install mailtrim
mailtrim setup     # connect Gmail or IMAP — guided, ~2 minutes
mailtrim stats     # see your inbox ranked by clutter
mailtrim purge     # interactive: pick senders, confirm, done
```

Or open the web UI:

```bash
pip install "mailtrim[web]"
mailtrim serve     # opens http://localhost:8484 in your browser
```

---

## Example output

### `mailtrim stats`

```
Provider: Gmail  ·  AI: OFF  (nothing leaves your machine)

34% of your inbox is clutter — caused by just 3 senders. 87.4 MB gone in one command.

 #  Impact  Sender                Emails   Size    Oldest      Risk
 1  100     LinkedIn Jobs            312   44 MB   847d ago    🟢 Safe
 2   82     Substack Weekly          183   26 MB   512d ago    🟢 Safe
 3   29     Shopify Receipts          94   12 MB   203d ago    🟢 Safe
```

### `mailtrim triage` (cloud or local AI)

```
⚡ HIGH  Reply needed — your manager asked a direct question     [reply]
         From: boss@company.com · action_required

· MED   Newsletter — weekly digest you subscribed to            [unsubscribe]
         From: digest@substack.com · newsletter

  LOW   Automated notification, no action needed                [archive]
         From: noreply@github.com · notification
```

### `mailtrim purge`

```
  Your selection: LinkedIn Jobs (312 emails · 44 MB)

  Move 312 emails to Trash? (undo available for 30 days) [y/N]: y
  ✓ Moved 312 emails to Trash.   mailtrim undo 1  — to reverse
```

---

## Web UI

`mailtrim serve` starts a local web server at `http://localhost:8484`.

| Page | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | Inbox summary — reclaimable space, top senders, best next action |
| **Stats** | Full sender table with filters, sort, and bulk purge |
| **Triage** | AI card grid — priority, category, explanation, suggested action per email |
| **Sync** | Cache inbox metadata locally for instant repeated stats/purge |
| **Undo History** | Reverse any operation within its 30-day window |
| **Settings** | AI mode, Ollama config, provider, protected senders |

The web UI uses HTMX for live updates (sync progress, stats loading) with no JavaScript framework.

---

## AI features

AI is off by default. Enable with `mailtrim config ai-mode cloud` or `mailtrim config ai-mode local`.

### Cloud (Anthropic)

```bash
mailtrim config ai-mode cloud    # requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
mailtrim triage                  # classify unread inbox
mailtrim bulk "archive all newsletters older than 60 days"
mailtrim digest                  # weekly summary — patterns, action items, one cleanup suggestion
mailtrim avoid                   # surface emails you've seen but never acted on
```

Only email subjects and snippets (≤300 characters) are sent to Anthropic — never full body content.

### Local (Ollama)

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
mailtrim config ai-mode local    # zero network calls — runs on your machine
mailtrim triage
```

In the web UI, go to **Settings → AI Mode → Local** to set your Ollama URL and model.
Any model in `ollama list` works — `llama3.2`, `mistral`, `gemma3`, etc.

### What AI classifies

Each email gets:
- **Priority**: high / medium / low
- **Category**: action_required · conversation · newsletter · notification · receipt · calendar · social · spam
- **Explanation**: one sentence (why it was classified this way)
- **Suggested action**: reply · archive · unsubscribe · delete · keep · delegate
- **Deadline hint**: extracted time pressure, e.g. "by Friday" or "this week"

---

## Background daemon

`mailtrim watch` runs a persistent heartbeat agent — one per registered account — that wakes up on a schedule, fetches unread emails, and runs AI triage automatically.

```bash
mailtrim watch                    # triage every 30 minutes (default)
mailtrim watch --interval 15      # every 15 minutes
mailtrim watch --interval 5 --now # start immediately, then every 5 minutes
```

To run as a background service on Linux:
```bash
# Create a systemd user service
cat > ~/.config/systemd/user/mailtrim-watch.service << EOF
[Unit]
Description=mailtrim heartbeat daemon

[Service]
ExecStart=$(which mailtrim) watch --interval 30
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
EOF

systemctl --user enable --now mailtrim-watch
```

## Setup

### Gmail (OAuth)

```bash
# 1. Get credentials.json from Google Cloud Console (~10 minutes, one-time)
#    console.cloud.google.com → New project → Gmail API → OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Desktop app)
#    Download JSON → save to ~/.mailtrim/credentials.json

# 2. Authenticate
mailtrim auth    # opens browser once, saves token locally

# 3. Run
mailtrim stats
```

> **"This app isn't verified"** — expected. You're authorising your own app to access your own inbox. Click **Advanced → Go to mailtrim (unsafe)** to proceed.

### IMAP (Outlook, Fastmail, iCloud, self-hosted)

```bash
mailtrim setup    # choose IMAP — enter server, user, password
```

Your server/user/port are saved to `~/.mailtrim/.env`. The password is never stored on disk:

```bash
export MAILTRIM_IMAP_PASSWORD="your-app-password"   # set in your shell profile
```

## Confidence scores

`purge` shows a 0–100 score estimating how safe bulk-deletion is:

| Signal | Weight |
|---|---|
| `List-Unsubscribe` header present | +30 pts |
| Age ≥ 180 days in inbox | up to +35 pts |
| Volume ≥ 50 from one sender | up to +35 pts |
| Transactional keywords (invoice, receipt, order) | −25 pts |

🟢 ≥70 Safe · 🟡 40–69 Review · 🔴 Sensitive (bank, health, legal — never auto-suggested)

Scores are heuristics. The 30-day undo exists because no heuristic is perfect.

---

## Privacy

**Nothing leaves your machine unless you explicitly enable cloud AI.**

- All data in `~/.mailtrim/` — no telemetry, no external sync
- OAuth token stored `chmod 0600`
- `stats`, `purge`, `undo`, `setup`, `serve` are fully local
- Cloud AI sends only subjects + snippets (≤300 chars per email), never full body
- AI mode shown in every command output:
  - `AI: OFF   no data leaves your machine` (default)
  - `AI: LOCAL  runs on your machine — nothing sent externally`
  - `AI: CLOUD  subjects + snippets sent to Anthropic`

Revoke Gmail access: [myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) → remove mailtrim

~/.mailtrim/
├── .env                  # persisted config (MAILTRIM_* vars)
├── credentials.json      # OAuth client secret from Google Cloud
├── token.json            # OAuth access/refresh token (chmod 0600)
├── mailtrim.db           # SQLite — emails, undo logs, rules, blocklist, follow-ups

## Installation options

```bash
pip install mailtrim              # CLI only
pip install "mailtrim[web]"       # + web UI (mailtrim serve)
pip install "mailtrim[headless]"  # + Playwright for unsubscribe browser fallback
pip install "mailtrim[web,headless]"  # everything
```

Requires Python 3.11+.

---

## Troubleshooting

```bash
mailtrim doctor    # diagnoses auth, connection, storage, config
```

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Gmail connection expired" | `mailtrim auth` |
| "Token file not found" | `mailtrim auth` |
| "Cannot write to ~/.mailtrim/" | `chmod 700 ~/.mailtrim` |
| Scan feels slow | `mailtrim stats --max-scan 500` |
| Not seeing enough senders | `mailtrim stats --scope anywhere` |
| IMAP connection failed | Re-run `mailtrim setup` |
| Web UI won't start | `pip install "mailtrim[web]"` then retry |
| Ollama triage times out | Model too large — try `llama3.2` (3B), check `ollama ps` |

## Testing

```bash
pip install "mailtrim[dev]"
pytest tests/ -v    # no credentials needed — AI paths use MockAIEngine
```
