## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.4.2] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- `postmind version` command and `postmind --version` / `-V` flag — prints `postmind <version>`
  and exits; version string sourced from `postmind.__version__` (single source of truth)

---

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Gmail setup now clears stale IMAP settings from `.env`** — switching from IMAP back to
  Gmail via `postmind setup` previously left `POSTMIND_IMAP_USER` and related keys in `.env`,
  causing every subsequent command to prompt for an IMAP password even on a Gmail account.
  Setup now writes `POSTMIND_PROVIDER=gmail` and strips all `POSTMIND_IMAP_*` lines on success.
- **Consistent provider resolution** — `_resolve_imap_settings` had two bugs:
  1. The "gmail" fallback only fired when settings failed to load entirely; if `POSTMIND_PROVIDER`
     was absent from `.env` (pre-v0.3.0 installs), the resolved provider silently became `""`.
     Fixed to `provider or persisted or "gmail"` — "gmail" is always the ultimate default.
  2. Stale IMAP settings (server, user, port, folder) were returned even when the resolved
     provider was Gmail, allowing them to accidentally satisfy the IMAP password prompt guard.
     IMAP values are now zeroed immediately when `resolved_provider != "imap"`.
- **Silent `except OSError: pass` replaced with explicit warnings** — `.env` write failures in
  both the Gmail and IMAP setup paths now print a yellow warning explaining what failed and how
  to recover, rather than silently swallowing the error.

### Added
- **Provider indicator line** — `stats`, `quickstart`, and `purge` now print a single dim line
  at the start of each run showing the active provider:
  - Gmail: `Provider: Gmail`
  - IMAP: `Provider: IMAP (server: imap.example.com)`

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **IMAP provider persistence** — `postmind setup` now writes all IMAP connection settings
  (`POSTMIND_PROVIDER`, `MAILTRIM_IMAP_SERVER`, `POSTMIND_IMAP_USER`, `MAILTRIM_IMAP_PORT`,
  `MAILTRIM_IMAP_FOLDER`) to `~/.postmind/.env`; every subsequent command reads these
  automatically — no flags required after first-time setup
- `_resolve_imap_settings()` helper in CLI — merges CLI flags with persisted settings;
  CLI values always win, persisted values fill in any gaps
- **IMAP Trash folder detection via SPECIAL-USE** (RFC 6154) — `_get_trash_folder()` method
  checks the `\Trash` attribute in the IMAP `LIST` response before falling back to well-known
  names (`Trash`, `Deleted Items`, `Deleted Messages`); detected folder is cached per connection
- **Undo result breakdown** — IMAP `undo` now shows restored count and skipped count
  separately (`✓ Restored N · ⚠ Skipped M`) with a brief explanation of why UIDs may change
  after a folder MOVE on non-Gmail IMAP servers
- `_reset_settings` autouse fixture in test suite — resets `_settings` cache and sets IMAP
  env vars to known defaults between tests; prevents the user's real `~/.postmind/.env` from
  affecting test outcomes

### Changed
- `stats`, `quickstart`, `purge`, `undo`, `doctor` `--provider` option now defaults to `""`
  (reads from persisted config) rather than `"gmail"` — IMAP users no longer need to pass
  `--provider imap` on every run
- `quickstart`, `stats`, `purge`, `undo`, `doctor` docstrings updated to reflect IMAP
  compatibility and zero-flag usage after setup
- `doctor --provider imap` now uses the persisted `imap_server`/`imap_user` from settings
  when those flags are omitted

### Fixed
- **Safety: `batch_trash` was permanently deleting messages when IMAP MOVE was unsupported**
  — the fallback now does COPY → Trash then STORE `\Deleted` + EXPUNGE on the source,
  preserving recoverability; if no Trash folder is found, the operation returns 0 and logs
  a warning rather than silently destroying email
- `doctor` IMAP Trash check updated to use `_get_trash_folder()` (SPECIAL-USE aware) instead
  of name-only matching

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-01

### Added
- `postmind setup` — guided first-time onboarding: provider selection (Gmail/IMAP),
  auth, health checks, and first inbox scan in ~2 minutes
- `postmind stats --since <Nd>` and `postmind purge --since <Nd>` — time-based filtering;
  translates to `newer_than:Nd` for Gmail and `SINCE` criteria for IMAP
- `postmind stats --share` — shareable summary output in Twitter (≤280 chars) or plain format;
  no personal data, top domains only
- **AI trust boundary system** — `ai_status_line()` helper; AI state badge (`AI: OFF / LOCAL / CLOUD`)
  visible in `stats`, `quickstart`, and `doctor`; `_cloud_ai_warning()` panel shown before any
  cloud AI command; `require_cloud()` wrapped in try/except in all four AI commands for clean exits

### Changed
- `quickstart` redesigned for instant value: ≤10 lines of output, safe candidates, undo hint,
  best first action surfaced immediately
- README rewritten for v0.3.0: trust-first framing, 35% shorter, structured for GitHub visitors
- `AIModeError` now renders multi-line messages in `_handle_error` (first line bold, rest dim)

---

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- `postmind doctor` — health check command: verifies auth token, Gmail connection,
  Trash access, data directory, undo storage, config, and optional local AI endpoint.
  Prints ✓/⚠/✗ per check with actionable fix hints. Exits non-zero when required checks fail.
- `postmind quickstart` — guided first-run command: checks auth, scans 500 messages,
  explains what was found, surfaces the single safest first cleanup action.
- `--verbose` / `--simple` flags on `stats`:
  - `--verbose` shows ACCOUNT SUMMARY, KEY INSIGHTS, domain patterns, full TOP SENDERS table
  - `--simple` shows plain-language recommendations without scores or tables
- `postmind stats --max-scan` default raised from 300 → 1000 for better coverage
- Human-readable error messages: 401/expired token, network timeouts, permission errors,
  rate limits, and database corruption all show plain-language guidance instead of raw tracebacks
- Local-only usage metrics (`~/.postmind/usage.json`): command runs, emails trashed,
  undo count, first run date — never uploaded, used only for local product insight
- `DEMO.md` — 60-second demo script for recording an asciinema/vhs walkthrough

### Changed
- `--permanent` flag on `purge` is now hidden from `--help` and requires a second
  `--i-understand-permanent` flag; confirmation phrase changed to `DELETE FOREVER`
- `--imap-password` CLI flag removed from `stats` and `purge` — now read from
  `MAILTRIM_IMAP_PASSWORD` env var or interactive hidden prompt (no shell history leak)
- `purge` docstring: "delete" → "move to Trash (recoverable)"
- `stats` docstring: "delete" → "move to Trash"
- `_action_explanation()` now says "Moves … to Trash (recoverable)" instead of "Deletes"
- `digest`, `avoid`, `follow-up`, and `stats --ai` marked `[EXPERIMENTAL]` in help text
- `undo` completion message: "Restored X emails" with progress spinner
- `_print_cleanup_complete`: undo hint is now bold and prominent

### Fixed
- `test_confidence_safety_label_medium` and `_low` tests updated to match current
  `confidence_safety_label()` return values ("Needs review", "Sensitive / personal")

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-05

### Added
- `stats` — rank senders by storage impact with confidence scoring (no API key needed)
- `purge` — interactive bulk delete with 30-day undo window
- `triage` — optional AI inbox classification via Claude (subjects + snippets only, never full body)
- `sync` — pull inbox into local cache for fast repeated queries
- `unsubscribe` — RFC 8058 one-click + mailto fallback + Playwright headless fallback
- `follow-up` — conditional reminder drafts ("remind me if they haven't replied")
- `rules` — save and replay natural language cleanup rules
- `avoid` — surface emails viewed 3+ times with no action taken
- `digest` — weekly plain-text inbox summary
- `undo` — reverse any bulk operation within the 30-day window
- MockAIEngine — full test suite runs without Gmail credentials or Anthropic key
- 115 tests passing on Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
